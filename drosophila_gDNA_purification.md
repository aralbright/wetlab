## Materials
- Ethanol (70% and 100%)
- Homogenization buffer
	- 100 mM Tris Cl
	- 100 mM EDTA
	- 1% (v/v) SDS
- Phenol:Chloroform
	- 1:1 volume ratio<sup>1</sup>
	- Shake then centrifuge for 10 min at 4000 rcf
- 8 M potassium acetate
- TE buffer
	- 10 mM Tris Cl
	- 0.1 mM EDTA

## Procedure
### Homogenization
1.	Place one fly per microcentrifuge tube and keep on ice.
2.	Add 50 µL homogenization buffer. Homogenize with sterile pestle while on ice. Wash pestle with 200 µL homogenization buffer into microcentrifuge tube.
3.	Incubate tubes at 70 °C for 30 min.
4.	(Optional) Briefly return to ice to lower temperature. Add 1 µL RNAse A. Incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.
5.	Return to ice. Add 35 µL 8 M potassium acetate. Mix by flicking tube or inversion. Do not vortex.<sup>2</sup>
6.	Incubate on ice for 30 min.
7.	Centrifuge for 15 min at 12,000 rcf.
8.	Transfer supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube. Discard precipitate.

### Phenol-Chloroform Extraction
9.	In fume hood, add 250 µL phenol:chloroform.
10.	Mix by shaking. Do not vortex.<sup>2</sup>
11.	Centrifuge tube for 5 min at maximum speed.<sup>3</sup>
12.	Transfer upper aqueous phase to a new microcentrifuge tube.<sup>4</sup>
13.	(Optional) Repeat steps 9-12 until no protein is visible at the interface of the organic and aqueous phases. Combine the aqueous phases.
14.	Add an equal volume of chloroform and repeat steps 10-12.5

### DNA Precipitation
15.	(Optional) Add 1 uL glycogen or glycogen blue to assist in visualization of pellet.
16.	Add 2 volumes of ice-cold ethanol and mix the solution well. Store the solution on ice for 15 min to allow the DNA to precipitate.6
17.	Carefully remove supernatant without disturbing pellet.
18.	Wash pellet with 70% ethanol. Centrifuge for 5 min at maximum speed.
19.	Carefully remove supernatant without disturbing pellet.
20.	Dry pellet by leaving tube open on bench at room temperature until last traces of fluid have evaporated.
21.	Dissolve DNA pellet in 100 µL TE (or desired volume of other buffer).

## Notes
1. Substituting 24:1 chloroform:isoamyl alcohol for the chloroform can prevent foaming.

2. The organic and aqueous phases may be mixed by vortexing when isolating small DNA molecules (<10 kb) or by gentle shaking when isolating DNA molecules of moderate size (10–30 kb). When isolating large DNA molecules (>30 kb), the following precautions must be taken to avoid shearing:
	- Mix the organic and aqueous phases by rotating the tube slowly (20 rpm) on a wheel for several hours.
	- Use large-bore pipettes to transfer the DNA from one tube to another.

3. After centrifugation, the phenol:chloroform should form clearly separated layers:
	- Top phase: aqueous phase (DNA)
	- Middle phase: A white layer may appear, consisting of precipitated protein particles
	- Bottom phase: organic phase (protein)

4. To achieve the best recovery, the organic phase and interface may be “back-extracted” as follows: After the first aqueous phase has been transferred as described above, add an equal volume of TE (pH 7.8) to the organic phase and interface. Mix well. Separate the phases by centrifugation as in Step 3. Combine this second aqueous phase with the first and proceed to Step 5.

5. This subsequent extraction with chloroform removes any lingering traces of phenol from the nucleic acid preparation.

6. One volume of isopropanol may be used in place of 2 volumes of ethanol to precipitate DNA. Precipitation with isopropanol has the advantage that the volume of liquid to be centrifuged is smaller. However, isopropanol is less volatile than ethanol and is therefore more difficult to remove; moreover, solutes like sucrose or sodium chloride are more easily coprecipitated with DNA when isopropanol is used. In general, precipitation with ethanol is preferable, unless it is necessary to keep the volume of fluid to a minimum.
