##Mounting Embryos for Live Imaging

###Purpose:
This protocol is intended for mounting small numbers living embryos from small collection cages with apple juice agar plates.

###Stage and Collect Embryos
1.	Remove apple juice plate from embryo collection cage after the desired time.
2. Coat apple juice agar in Halocarbon 27 oil.
3. Observe the plate on a dissecting microscope that is capable of using transmitted light (I use the Leica next to the confocal).
4. Using forceps, pick up individual embryos of the desired stage (e.g., NC14).
  * If I want to image embryos in NC14, for example, I usually try to collect embryos that are in NC12 or 13, so that by the time I actually start collecting images, they will be approaching the correct stage.
  * It’s easiest to gather the embryos on one prong of your forceps as you pick them up, until you have a suitable amount (10-20).
  * The apple juice agar and transmitted light are important here, because you can image through the clear agar and stage the embryos as you collect them. This doesn’t work nearly as well with grape juice agar, because the plates are too dark.

###Dechorionate
1. Prepare two small (~½ inch square) pieces of paper towel.
2. Move your embryos to one of the paper towel squares and gently touch the prong of your forceps with the embryos to the paper towel and let the oil absorb into the paper towel square.
3. Once most of the oil has been sufficiently removed, transfer the ball of embryos to the second clean paper towel square and gently scrape the forceps against the towel to release the embryos.
4. Place the paper towel square with the embryos in a clean lid from an apple juice plate.
5. Use a squirt bottle to just saturate the paper towel square in bleach. Incubate for 2-3 minutes or until you see the chorion dissolving.
  * Warning: If you add too much bleach, your embryos will float away.
6. While the embryos are dechorionating, prepare some droplets of clean water.
  * I like to do this in the lids of apple juice plates.
  * Use a squirt bottle to make free-standing and well separated water droplets inside of the lid.
  * I find that 6 droplets (3 per lid, in a triangular arrangement) is usually sufficient to rinse all of the bleach.
7. Pick up the bleach-soaked paper towel square with forceps and place it embryo side-up onto a clean (full sized) paper towel to remove the excess bleach. 
8. Pick up paper towel square with forceps and dip one edge into a clean droplet of water, being careful not to submerge the embryos.
  * You want to wick up water into the paper towel, not rinse it off.
9. Dab paper towel square back onto the clean paper towel to absorb excess water.
10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 until the bleach has been removed. 
  * If there is still remaining bleach, the clean paper towel will turn pink when you dab off the excess water.

###Mount
1. Secure gas permeable membrane between the two pieces of a plastic slide, with the hydrophobic side of the membrane on the flat surface of the slide. Remove excess membrane with a razor blade.
  *The gas permeable membrane has a hydrophobic side and a hydrophilic side. To make sure you’re mounting the embryos on the correct side, use a Sharpie to draw a mark on the membrane. If it’s on the hydrophobic side, the ink will bead up. If it’s on the hydrophilic side, it will not.
2. Place a droplet of halocarbon oil on the gas permeable membrane in the middle of the slide.
3. Gently pick up your dechorionated embryos from the paper towel square and transfer them into the droplet of oil.
  * I like to do this with a hair loop instead of the forceps, because the dechorionated embryos are very fragile and easy to squish.
4. Use the hair loop or any embryo manipulating tool you prefer to distribute the oil across the membrane and to distribute the embryos within it.
I like to make neat rows of embryos so they will be easy to find when you’re scanning with the confocal.
5. Very gently pick up a coverslip with forceps and slowly lower it over the embryos on the slide, starting from one edge. The goal here is to avoid introducing air bubbles and to maintain the arrangement of embryos as much as possible.
6. Get those images.
