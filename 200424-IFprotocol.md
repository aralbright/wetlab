# Title : Immunostaining in Drosophila embryos
### Author: Jenna Haines
### Date: 07/16/18
# Introduction: 

This protocol is adapted from Brand 1999, Drosophila Protocols (CSH) 2000, and from Colleen Hannon for Double staining. I have included notes from an example experiment for reference. The fixation protocol is three days long (not including the collection and fixation). Days 2 and 3 can be combined but that would be a very long day. All washes are at room temperature except overnight washes or incubations which are at 4ËšC. This protocol includes a fix with paraformaldehyde in a solution containing Triton. The Triton makes it easier to use plastic tubes but experiments comparing paraformaldehyde, formaldehyde, and heat fixation showed little difference for both the anti-Zelda and anti-Bicoid antibody so any other preferred fixation method is fine.

If performing a double staining, make sure that primary antibodies are from different host species so that the secondary antibodies do not detect the wrong antibody. Do single stainings of each primary before or concurrently with the immunostaining.
