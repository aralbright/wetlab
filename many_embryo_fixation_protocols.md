# Title : Fixation methods for *Drosophila* embryos 
### Author: Jenna Haines
### Date: 05/04/2020
# Introduction: 

There are many different ways to fix *Drosophila* embryos that are often specific for different downstream applications. While most applications use Formaldehyde or Para-formaldehyde - other methods like methanol or heat fixation can also be used. Here, I consolidate several fixation protocols that have been used successfully in the Eisen lab. 

All fixation protocols have three parts. Part 1 is the fixation. Part 2 is the devitilination. Part 3 consists of the final washes and long term storage. Many of these protocols are fairly similar to one another but have been optimized for various purposes. Like virtually all protocols, not all of the differences between methods have been thoroughly tested. My aim here is to present the various flavors of fixation methods that have been explored by the lab. 

*** WARNING: Formaldehyde, Heptane, hexane, and methanol are very hazardous and should not be used outside the hood. Please read the SDS for each chemical thoroughly (I AM NOT KIDDING - DO IT!!!) before using. If any is spilled, notify a lab member immediately and do not panic. Always wear gloves, safety glasses, and a lab coat and change gloves often. While wearing gloves, do not touch anything that you would normally touch without gloves on (like your phone!!!).

# Formaldehyde Fixation 
### Application notes: 
This protocol is based off of [this protocol](http://bdtnp.lbl.gov:8080/Fly-Net/content/bid/doc/fixation_collection.pdf) adapted for use in our lab by Ashley Albright (09/20/18). She used this fixation method for RNA *in situ* hybridizations.

### Protocol

#### Collect and dechorinate embryos 
1. Collect embryos in choice of cage. We have used [medium cages](https://www.kisker-biotech.com/frontoffice/product?produitId=0H-19-17), small cages (we call them baby cages), apple juice "cup" cages (via Colleen Hannon), or a population cage. Age embryos to the desired stage. 
2. When ready to collect, depending on the plate used, add 50% bleach to the embryos for 2-3 minutes.
    - For baby cages with grape plates - rinse embryos directly into a collection sieve with water. Then add bleach to a deep petri dish or a pipette tip box and submerge the sieve into the bleach.
    - for molasses plates or apple juice plates with a descent holding capacity - add 50% bleach straight to the plate. Use a paintbrush to dislodge the embryos and dissolve the yeast into solution. 
3. Pour bleach solution containing embryos and yeast into the collection sieve.
4. Rinse embryos with water for several minutes until the basket no longer smells like bleach. 
#### Fixation
5. Use a paintbrush to transfer embryos to a labeled scintillation vial containing 3 mL 1.3 X PBS.
6. In a chemical hood, add 4 mL heptane and 1 mL of 37% formaldehyde to the vial.
7. Shake at an angle on a shaker for 20 minutes, ~150 RPM (time sensitive).
8. Devitellinize embryos by adding 10 mL methanol and vortexing for ~30 seconds. The embryos should fall to the bottom of the tube. The ones that float were either not devitellinized or did not fix correctly. Sometimes this is a sizeable percentage - I have never been able to figure out why. 
9. Take off the methanol and floating embryos, being careful to leave all the embryos that fell to the bottom of the vial. 10. Add 1 ml of methanol and pipette embryos with a cut 1000ml tip to a labeled eppendorf tube.
11. Was 3x with 1ml of methanol. 
12. Store at -20˚C in methanol. Embryos can keep for > 1 year stored this way.

# Paraformaldehyde Fixation (Jenna Haines IF and DNA FISH protocol)
## Application Notes:
This protocol was developed for IF and DNA FISH where small numbers of embryos are collected for each condition. Ampules of 16% Paraformaldehyde were used instead of the bottle of 37% formaldehyde. Paraformaldehyde is essentially the powdered polymer that, in solution, breaks down into the monomeric formaldehyde (more on the differences [here](http://publish.uwo.ca/~jkiernan/formglut.htm)). Formaldehyde can be substituted. I performed DNA FISH with this protocol substituting Formaldehyde for the PFA and saw no difference.This protocol also uses triton in the fixation mixture so that the embryos don't stick to the sides of the tube. Therefore, this fixation needs to be gently rocked.  Some antibodies stain better in formaldehyde fix or methanol-only fixes depending on the antibody.

## Protocol

### Collection.
1.	Clear for <30 minutes. Embryos collection for 2:00 and aged for 1:20. 
	These times are to collect mostly embryos before nuclear cycle 14.
2.	Embryos are bleached for 2-3 minutes in 50% Bleach to dechorionate. Rinse well with water. Pat dry on towel. 
3.	Rinse with 1xPBS + 0.5% Triton. 
4.	Take a large brushful of embryos and place them in a 1.5ml tube filled with 1xPBS + 0.5% Triton.
5.	Take off and wash with H20. 
6.	Take off supernatant and wash with 100% isopropanol. 

### Fix. 
7.	Add 500ul of Heptane + 500ul of fixative solution in an eppi
8.	Fix for 30 minutes with gentle rocking on the rotator plate. 
9.	Remove the lower aqueous layer and replace with 750ul of methanol and vortex for exactly 30 seconds to remove the vitelline membrane. 
	- TIP: Embryos that sink have their vitelline membrane removed; those that stay at the interface still have their vitelline membranes.
10.	Remove as much heptane and methanol as possible. Replace with fresh methanol and wash rapidly (10 seconds). 
11.	Add 1ml of fresh methanol and keep O/N at 4˚C.

# Formaldehyde and hexane fixations (Xiao-Yong ChIP-seq protocol).
## Application Notes:
This fix protocol was used for fixing large batches of embryos for ChIP-seq by Xiao-Yong. Importantly, this protocol does not have a methanol devitalination step (probably because embryos are going to be homogenized for chromatin immunoprecipitation) 
## Materials
- 250ml bottle 
- Stir bar
- 50 ml conical 
- collection sieve 
- Drosophila cages/collection plates
- [Hexanes](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigald/139386?lang=en&region=US)
- [37% formaldehyde](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/SIGMA/F8775?lang=en&region=US)
- [10x PBS](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/70011044#/70011044)

## Solutions
|  	|    Final conc   	|      stock conc     	|   for 10mls of top layer	|  
|:--:	|:-----------:	|:--------------:	|:-: |

|  Hexane	|  	| 	|   210.5ml	| 
## Protocol
1. Prepare the crosslinking solution by stirring with a stir bar for 30 minutes. Take off the top layer for crosslinking.
2. Collect embryos into sieve. Wash with water.
3. Dechorionate for 2  minutes in 50% bleach
2.	Completely immerse the embryos in a beaker of 100% isopropanol and shake back and forth to disperse clumps. Remove cup and dry embryos as much as possible with paper towels beneath the mesh.
3.	Transfer embryos with a paintbrush to a 50ml Falcon tube containing 10 mls formaldehyde saturated hexanes per gram of embryos (I often used 30mls when using population cages).  Shake vigorously for 5 minutes at room temperature.  Allow the embryos to settle and pour off as much of the solution as possible (in the hood).
4.	Resuspend embryos in 40mls of 1X PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 and shake vigorously at room temp for 5 minutes.  
5.	Pour embryos onto small nylon mesh tube and repeat with fresh buffer.  Embryos should clump at first but then eventually become monodispersed.
6. Pour all of the embryos in PBST into a small mesh to collect them, then use a paintbrush to transfer them to an Eppendorf tube containing 1ml of 1X PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 - these can be kept for about a week or so at 4˚C. Alternatively, you can transfer embryos to a tube (dry) and then flash freeze in liquid nitrogen and keep at -80˚C. 

# Paraformaldehyde and Triton Fixation for ChIP-seq

## Application Notes:
This protocol is from Colleen Hannon and the Weischaus lab for Chip-seq experiments. Embryos are crosslinked for EXACTLY 15 minutes at room temp before the fixation is quenched by Glycine. 

## Materials
-	Embryos
-	Bleach
-	PBS/0.5% Triton X-100 (Kept at room temp in a squirt bottle and also a separate stock at 4°C).
-	PBS/0.5% Triton X-100/125mM Glycine (that’s 235mg Glycine per 25ml)
-	Heptane
-	20ml High-Recovery Vials (V-Bottom Tubes) VWR 89042-310
-	20% Paraformaldehyde solution
-	Timer
-	Tubes that fit with the Pellet Pestle Homogenizers (Kontes)

## Solutions
Heptane solution / sample
•	6 ml heptane
•	2ml PBS + 0.5% TritonX-100

Quenching Solution – 25mls
•	PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100 – 25mls
•	125mM Glycine – 235mg

## Protocol

1.	Embryos laid for 2:00 and aged for 2:00.
2.	For each sample to be collected, prepare a 2ml PBS/0.5% Triton X-100 + 6ml Heptane solution in a 20ml V-Bottom tube (they use the Ex-traction tubes).
3.	Dechorionate for ~1 minute in bleach, collect in a basket
4.	the basket, wash embryos extensively in dH2O. The embryos should float.
5.	In the basket, rinse embryos extensively in PBS/0.5% Triton X-100, I typically use enough to fill a 60mm Petri Dish lid. The embryos should sink in this solution.
6.	In the basket, blot embryos dry on a paper towel.
7.	Transfer embryos to the prepared 20ml V-Bottom (black topped) with the heptane solution by  moving the embryos with a paintbrush.
8.	Add 180ul 20% Paraformaldehyde solution from the glass bottles to the V-Bottom tube, cap the tube, and
9.	Start a timer for 15 minutes.
10.	Vortex on high for 30 seconds. The solution should turn milky white.
11.	Mix the samples for 10 minutes on a rotary shaker set to ~120rpm.
12.	Collect the embryos at the bottom of the tube and separate the liquid fractions by centrifugation at 500xg for 1 minute. The upper organic phase will have the consistency of shampoo. This is OK. Put the collection tube in a 50ml conical and spin on the large centrifuge.
13.	Transfer embryos (now at the bottom of the tube) to a 1.5ml centrifuge tube. Allow embryos to settle to the bottom. They will probably be medium- clumpy. This is OK.
14.	Remove as much supernatant as possible without losing any embryos.
15.	At 15 minutes after the start of fixation (Step 8) when the timer goes off, add ~1ml of PBS/0.5% Triton X-100/125mM Glycine to the embryos in order to quench the crosslinking reaction. Vortex for 30 seconds on high. Incubate for at least one minute.
16.	Transfer embryos to ice. Wash embryos 3x in ~1ml of ice-cold PBS/0.5% Triton X-100. 

	At this point, if embryos are to be ChIPped in bulk, then they can either be used right away or be stored at -80°C (after removing as much supernatant as possible) until needed. If embryos are to be sorted, this must be done before freezing.

# Heat Fixation (from Colleen)
For Heat fixing:
	Make a 1x salt solution. Add 5mls to a scintillation vial and microwave until the lid jiggles < 30 seconds.
	Put dechorionated embryos in a mesh basket and wash gently with H2O. 
	With tweezers, plunge the basket into the hot salt solution and shake around so the embryos fall out. 
	Fill half way with ice and let sit on an ice bucket until all the ice is melted. 
	Suck off as much liquid as possible and fill with 1ml heptane and 1ml MeOH. Vortex for 30 seconds and remove as much liquid as possible.
	Transfer embryos to a new tube and wash 3x with MeOH. Keep O/N at 4dC
