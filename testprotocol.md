# Title : Test protocol
### Author: Jenna Haines

# Introduction:

This is a test protocol to figure out how to write up wet lab protocols in markdown. This is also a demo of what formating syntax that should be used. 

The purpose is a brief description of what this document is (what experiments was it used for, is it derived from another protocol, links to publications that use it, and general thoughts or notes).
