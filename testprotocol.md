### Adding local images:
There are a bunch of ways to do this:
    1. upload to image hosting site and use the URL
    2. Followed [these directions](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib/wiki/How-to:-Add-images-to-the-Wiki) 
        - click on issues at the top
        - click the green "new issues" button 
        - drag and drop your local image into the text editor and it should upload it and transform it into markdown
        - paste that line into the md file
