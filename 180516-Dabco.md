### DABCO mounting media
### Author: Ashley Albright

# Introduction: 
This recipe is for a mounting media for confocal imaging of Drosophila embryos that uses DABCO to preserve the fluorescent signal. Slides mounted with this media have been successfully imaged up to one year later when slides are kept in the dark at -20˚C.
# Materials

- DABCO [sigma D27802](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sial/d27802?lang=en&region=US)
- glycerol
- PBS
- Rocking platform
