Lab protocols

- protocols can be in markdown or txt format. 

## Using lab protocols
* To download a single protocol from the repo : 
    - open terminal/console on your computer
    - type "wget" followed by the URL of the protocol
    - example: `wget https://github.com/meisenlab/wetlab/blob/master/testprotocol.md`
* To quickly print a markdown file (or save it as a PDF):
    - use a chrome extension (I like [this one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-markdown-printer/fehpdlpmcegfpbkgcnaleindodeegapk/related?hl=en-US))

    - do the stuff! edit, add files, delete files, ... the normal stuff

    - on github, make a pull request -
